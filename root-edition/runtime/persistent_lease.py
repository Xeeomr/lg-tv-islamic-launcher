"""Independent persistent-mode input-loop lease policy.

A device adapter must authenticate the root-owned lease and hold the transaction
lock inside restore. Only successful input-loop heartbeats may advance sequence;
process existence is not health. A separate durable intent is disabled before
recovery, preventing boot from re-enabling a failed mode.
